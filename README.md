# Person Age Simulation

A JavaScript project for a course assignment that simulates a dynamic list of people. The simulation:
- Creates an initial array of 4 people with random names and ages (1â€“50) using Faker.js.
- Increases each person's age by 1 every second.
- Removes people from the list when they reach 40 or older.
- Adds a new person with a random name and age every 2 seconds.

The list is displayed dynamically in developer console.
